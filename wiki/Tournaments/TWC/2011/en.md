### Disqualifications

Due to unexpected situation happened in Malaysia vs Philippines, I needed to take certain measures:

1.  Team Malaysia and Team Philippines is banned from #1 Taiko World Cup.
2.  Following players of Team Malaysia is banned from TWC till the next one: HeatKai, ffyong, taiko_maniac1811
3.  Following players of Team Philippines is banned from TWC till the next one: blacksymbian, caelumangelus, [Zero_One]

If you have anything to complain about this, don't post it here. Just forum-PM me.

I've sent several PM to captains about schedule, and I clearly warned about this, as I remember, and you clearly ignored it.

* * *

Oh, and after consideration, I revoke some measures done before.

ffyong, taiko_maniac1811, blacksymbian, caelumangelus, [Zero_One] are no longer banned.

* * *

HeatKai is no longer banned from TWC.
